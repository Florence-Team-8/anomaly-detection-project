#### 1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?

> - 1 (Full Stack PHP) - javascript-i    1144 page views
> - 2 (Java) -  javascript-i 19383 views
> - 3 (Data Science) - classification/overview     2469 page views
#### 3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
- Most of the pings are either towards the end of the program, or immediately the day after
- Some have a lot of pings at the beginning of the program start and stop once it hits two weeks
- about a third only ping the day of the program start or after

>There are a few possible explanations for this.  Perhaps the user unenrolled, or they changed their github user status. What is interesting is that some users only pinged towards the end of the program, the others pinged for the first two weeks. My assumption is that it could be a staff member pinging the system or it's people that left after two weeks

>Users 49,64, 278, 812, and 832 accessed the curriculum towards the end of the program

>Users 487, 1060 and 1065 accessed the curriculum within two weeks of the start date

>889 and 1059 access the database over a week or two and then stops.

#### 6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
>DS students ping the system the most after graduation. Mostly fundamentals looking at general info about pipeline. 

>The fifth through eleventh most pinged sites for graduates is web dev style looking at creating files and navigating the file system. 

> Both groups are looking at lessons that are at the beginning of the lessons. 

> Graduates pinging early lessons makes sense.
#### 7. Which lessons are least accessed?
